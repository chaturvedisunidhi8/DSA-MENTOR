"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock","You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.","Easy","Array,Dynamic Programming","Amazon,Facebook,Microsoft,Bloomberg,Google","1 ≤ prices.length ≤ 10^5|0 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^4","First line: n.
